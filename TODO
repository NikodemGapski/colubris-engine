[UI UPDATE]
- what if a component has a pointer to a gameobject that's been detroyed? how to handle dangling pointers? - HANDLES [UI UPDATE]
- general optimisations (data-oriented design)
- general event system [UI UPDATE]
- prefabs [UI UPDATE]
- a little issue with gameobjects having their render_layer set before registration (despite not yet belonging to the layer)
- bug: if a new GameObject is created in a start() method, regitration has a problem
- text aligning
- camera
- drawing collider outline for debugging
- faster collision detection for circles, sweeping (as a general collision optimisation)
- change font type, add integer font size (?)
- find an alternative to the 'handy transform variable` in gameobject (it's not safe being modifiable)
- is compounding z-index really a good thing? what if we don't want to have objects pass between parents and children, but we want to order the children in a certain way?
