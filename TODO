[UI UPDATE]

HANDLES
- what if a component has a pointer to a gameobject that's been detroyed? how to handle dangling pointers? - HANDLES [UI UPDATE]
- find an alternative to the 'handy transform variable` in gameobject (it's not safe being modifiable)

OPTIMISATIONS
- general optimisations (data-oriented design)
- faster collision detection for circles, sweeping (as a general collision optimisation)

NEW SYSTEMS
- error logging

RENDERING
- camera
- drawing collider outline for debugging
- texture rendering
- animation (?)

FONT
- dynamic scaling

UI ELEMENTS
- buttons, mouse interaction
- draggable components
- default shapes (text box, drop-down list, window)

OTHERS
- prefabs [UI UPDATE]

BUGS AND ISSUES:
- a little issue with gameobjects having their render_layer set before registration (despite not yet belonging to the layer)
- bug: if a new GameObject is created in a start() method, regitration has a problem
- is compounding z-index really a good thing? what if we don't want to have objects pass between parents and children, but we want to order the children in a certain way?
