[RENDERING UPDATE]
- OPTIMISE?!?!? 25 projectiles lags the whole engine!!
- a bit more testing

- fix constructor indentation


[UI UPDATE]
- what if a component has a pointer to a gameobject that's been detroyed? how to handle dangling pointers? [UI UPDATE]
- general event system [UI UPDATE]
- prefabs [UI UPDATE]
- a little issue with gameobjects having their render_layer set before registration (despite not yet belonging to the layer)
- bug: if a new GameObject is created in a start() method, regitration has a problem

Update the docs:
- DOCS: every gameobject MUST HAVE a transform component
- DOCS: remember about the compiler flag for the freetype library
- DOCS: revise the order of events (transform and z_index syncing)
- DOCS: if an object is inactive, then its children are as well
- DOCS: don't call update on a dead object; start method is always called
- DOCS: handy transform pointer in GameObject class
- DOCS: there is no void render layer
- DOCS: Which processes happen *during* update and which in a dedicated time window?
- DOCS: create a tree copy before update and traverse it
- DOCS: change method order: update, register pending, destroy pending (to fix the 'created and destroyed in one frame' scenario)
- DOCS: add method that gets global z_index traversing just up the tree
- DOCS: gameobject: is_alive (- make sure you don't assign a gameobject to a dead one [aka in the same frame it's been destroyed]) -> destroy the node right in the destroy_gameobject method, don't wait until pending
- DOCS: reimagine the game loop
- DOCS: register_pending method handles names and layers, but destroy_gameobject handles it too
- DOCS: main layers, render layers, collision layers
- DOCS: custom layers, layers can be used as chunks
- DOCS: layer collections, operation (beware: called on all ordered pairs of objects)
- DOCS: layers are responsible for gameobjects' layer pointers
- DOCS: adding to a main/render layer removes from the current one
- DOCS: list of LayerCollections, MainLayers, RenderLayers
- DOCS: LayerCollection - unique name, list of Layers, operation method, active, z_index
- DOCS: Layer - unique name per collection, list of objects, active, z_index
- DOCS: add hierarchy tree modification: set_parent, get_parent, get_children
- DOCS: incorporate collisions into a layer
- DOCS: currently a gameobject can belong to only one layer in a collection
- DOCS: Renderer::rgb_colour, rgba_colour
- DOCS: component_utils.hpp
- DOCS: mesh vec2, transform.normal_vector()
- DOCS: don't use negative scale in Transform
- DOCS: transform.global_position() etc
