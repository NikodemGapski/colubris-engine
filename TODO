- add collision layers
- add hierarchy tree modification

- add methods that synchronise what we need (global z_index / global transform) - just up the tree

- gameobject: is_alive (- make sure you don't assign a gameobject to a dead one [aka in the same frame it's been destroyed], don't call update on a dead object, what about destroying objects before their start method?)

- what if a component has a pointer to a gameobject that's been detroyed? how to handle dangling pointers? [UI UPDATE]
- general event system [UI UPDATE]

- fix constructor indentation

- what happens when a gameobject is removed from a render_layer? (some inactive layer that stores unassigned objects - every gameobject should be in some render_layer... or should it?)


Order of events:
- adding to the hierarchy tree happens during the registration process

Which processes should happen *during* update and which in a dedicated time window?
- outside of update: hierarchy tree topology changes (influence the order of update() calls)

- update the docs
- DOCS: every gameobject MUST HAVE a transform component
- DOCS: remember about the compiler flag for the freetype library
- DOCS: revise the order of events (transform and z_index syncing)
