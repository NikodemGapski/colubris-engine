# TODO

## HANDLES
- what if a component has a pointer to a gameobject that's been detroyed? how to handle dangling pointers? - HANDLES
- find an alternative to the 'handy transform variable' in gameobject (it's not safe being modifiable)

## OPTIMISATIONS
- general optimisations (data-oriented design)
- faster collision detection for circles, sweeping (as a general collision optimisation)

## NEW SYSTEMS
- error logging

## RENDERING
- camera
- drawing collider outline for debugging
- texture rendering
- animation (?)

## FONT
- dynamic scaling

## UI ELEMENTS
- buttons, mouse interaction
- draggable components
- default shapes (text box, drop-down list, window)

## OTHERS
- prefabs

## BUGS AND ISSUES:
- a little issue with gameobjects having their render_layer set before registration (despite not yet belonging to the layer)
- bug: if a new GameObject is created in a start() method, regitration has a problem
- dangling listeners (cannot unsubscribe to an event)

## DOCS

# Changes - UI update
- FONT
- EVENT SYSTEM
- improved render ordering
